\subsection*{Question 1}

Suppose $t_i\in S_i$ is strictly dominated by $s_i\in S_i$, but that $\sigma_i\in\Delta S_i$, which is supported by $t_i$ is not strictly dominated. Let $\sigma_i'\in\Delta S_i$ be a mixed strategy that has the same support as $\sigma_i$, but with $s_i$ played played with the same frequency as $t_i$ instead of $t_i$. Since $s_i$ strictly dominates $t_i$, this strategy results in a strictly higher payoff than $\sigma_i$. Therefore, $\sigma_i'$ strictly dominates $\sigma_i$.
\medskip \\
$\therefore$ by contradiction, any mixed strategy that contains a strictly-dominated pure strategy in its support is strictly dominated $\blacksquare$

%%%________________________________________________________________%%%

\subsection*{Question 2}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item This scenario is a game with two players ($N=\{1,2\}$) with identical strategy sets ${S_i=\{2,3,...,499,500\}}$, $i=1,2$, and payoff functions:
		\[
			u_i(s_i,s_j) = \begin{cases} s_i + 2, & s_i<s_j \\ s_i, & s_i = s_j \\ s_j - 2, & s_i>s_j \end{cases}\text{ , }i\in\{1,2\}\text{, }j\neq i
		\]
		
	\item Player 1's payoff maximization problem is 
		\[
			\usmax{s_1}u_1(s_1,s_2)
		\]
		Where player 1's payoff matrix is:
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{rcc}
									& $s_2 < \overline{s}_2$						& $s_2 = \overline{s}_2$			\\ \cline{2-3} 
			$s_1 < \overline{s}_2$	& \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$[s_2 -2, s_1 + 2]$}		& \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$s_1 + 2$}	\\ \cline{2-3}
			$s_1 = \overline{s}_2$	& \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$s_2 - 2$}				& \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$s_1$}		\\ \cline{2-3}
			$s_1 > \overline{s}_2$	& \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$s_2 - 2$}				& \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$s_2 - 2$}	\\ \cline{2-3}
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
		Thus, if $s_2=\overline{s}_2$, then player 1's best response is clearly less than $\overline{s}$, and if $s_2<\overline{s}_2$, then choosing $s_1<\overline{s}_2$ will, at worst, make player 1 as poor-off as if they chose $s_1\geq\overline{s}_2$ but will possibly make them better-off. Thus, player 1's best response is $s_1<\overline{s}_2$.
	
	\item Player 2 faces the same best response function that player 1 does. If you begin with the presumption that player 1 believes $\overline{s}_2\in[2,500]$ and iteratively remove strictly dominated strategies for each player, then you arrive at $s_1=s_2=2$ regardless of your initial choice of $\overline{s}_2$.
	
\end{enumerate}

%%%________________________________________________________________%%%

\subsection*{Question 3}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item No pure strategies in this game dominate any other pure strategies. However, player 2's pure strategy of $C$ is dominated by a mixed strategy of $L$ and $R$. Specifically, any strategy $\sigma_2=\pi L + (1-\pi)R$, where $\pi\in(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2})$ dominates $C$.
	
	\item If there is common knowledge of rationality between the players, then no player will play a strictly dominated player, and each player will choose a strategy as if the other player will not play a strictly dominated strategy. Thus, player 2 will choose $\pi$ such that player 1 is indifferent between $T$ and $B$. Player 1's payoff, based on $pi$ is:
		\[
			u_1(T) = 8(1-\pi)\text{, } u_1(B) = 2\pi + (1-\pi)5
		\]
		Player 1 is indifferent between $T$ and $B$ when $\pi = \frac{3}{5}$. Meanwhile, player 2 is indifferent between $L$ and $R$ when player 1 plays $T$ with probability $\frac{8}{11}$. Thus, our prediction of play in this game is
		\[
			\left(\frac{8}{11}T + \frac{3}{11}B, \frac{3}{5}L + \frac{2}{5}R\right)
		\]
\end{enumerate}

%%%________________________________________________________________%%%

\subsection*{Question 4}
All pure strategies in this game are rationalizable because, for each player, each pure strategy is a best response to one of the other player's actions. Thus, neither player can eliminate a pure strategy by playing a mixed strategy that doesn't include it. Under complete knowledge of rationality, then, this game will result in a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium that includes all possible moves for both players.

\subsection*{Question 5}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Each player, $i\in\{1,2\}$, in this game has strategy set $S_i=\{\text{seek},\text{don't seek}\}$, each with the payoff function (where $j\neq i$,
		\[
			u_i(s_i,s_j) = 
				\begin{cases} 
					0, 		& s_i = \text{ don't seek} \\ 
					r - c, 	& s_i = s_j = \text{ seek} \\ 
					R - c, 	& s_i = \text{, seek, } s_j = \text{ don't seek} 
				\end{cases}
		\]
		Which results in the following payoff matrix:
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{crcc}
			&					& \multicolumn{2}{c}{2}													\\
			&					& Seek								& Don't Seek						\\ \cline{3-4} 
			\multirow{2}{*}{1}						
			& Seek				& \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$(r-c,r-c)$}	& \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$(R-c,0)$}	\\ \cline{3-4}
			& Don't Seek		& \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$(0,R-c)$}	& \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$(0,0)$}		\\ \cline{3-4}
			
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
		
	\item If $r>c$, then seeking approval will be a strictly dominant strategy for each firm. If $r<c<R$, then there will be a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium, in which each firm seeks approval some of the time. If $R<c$, then not seeking approval is the clearly dominant strategy for both players, resulting in a pure strategy Nash equilibrium at $(\text{don't seek},\text{don't seek})$. However, if $c<r<R$, then both players are always strictly better off when they seek approval, regardless of the other players decision, resulting in a pure strategy Nash equilibrium of $(\text{seek},\text{seek})$.
\end{enumerate}
